# Logic Reconstruction: Intelligent LP Engagement Module

## 🔄 The Recursive Fundraising Engine

The module operates on a **Bimodal Feedback Loop** structured over a 120-day (4-month) window.

### 🗓️ Phase Breakdown

| Month | Phase | Key Objective | Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Design** | Strategy & Prep | Screening, Path Finding, Outreach Prep, Sourcing. |
| **02** | **Campaign** | Execution | Active LP outreach and sequence management. |
| **03** | **Feedback** | Analysis | LP response analysis, data synthesis, KPI tracking. |
| **04** | **Iterate** | Optimization | Refining targeting attributes for the next cycle. |

### 🛠️ Sub-Phase Mechanics (Design Phase)

#### 1. LP Screening

- **Identification**: Defining custom attributes (Fund Thesis, LP History).
- **Scoring**: Algorithmic scoring per LP (Fit, Capacity, Likelihood).
- **Aggregation**: Pipeline-level roll-up for executive prioritization.

#### 2. LP Path Finder

- Mapping network connections (Second-degree connections, Warm intros).

#### 3. LP Outreach

- Crafting narrative and setting up communication sequences.

#### 4. LP Sourcing

- Initial pool generation from global LP databases.

## 🧠 Algorithmic Logic (Inferred)

1. **Inputs**: Fund Thesis, Desired LP Tier, Historical Interaction Data.
2. **Process**:
   - `Generate Pool(Sourcing)` -> `Apply Filter(Screening)` -> `Score(fit_score, capacity_score)` -> `Rank(Priority)`.
3. **Outputs**: High-ROI LP Target List, Strategic Outreach Matrix.
